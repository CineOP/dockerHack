# Web Parsing for Tech Corporations

This Streamlit project is focused on web parsing for tech corporations. It allows users to easily extract information from tech websites such as news articles, product information, and job postings. This information can be extremely valuable to corporations looking to keep up with industry trends, monitor competitor activity, or identify potential hiring candidates.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package installer
- Required libraries listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository using `git clone <repository URL>`
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To start the Streamlit application, navigate to the project directory and run `streamlit run app.py` on your terminal. This will open up a web browser where you can interact with the application.

### User Interface

The web application consists of three main sections:

1. **URL Input**: Allows users to input the URL of the website they wish to parse.
2. **Data Extraction**: This section displays the parsed data from the website. Users can select the type of data that they want to extract from the dropdown menu.
3. **Export Data**: This section provides the ability to export the extracted data as a CSV file.

Simply enter the URL of the website you want to parse, select the type of data you'd like to extract, and then click the "Extract Data" button. The extracted data will be displayed in the "Data Extraction" section. You can then export the data as a CSV file.

## Future Development

In the future, we plan to expand the capabilities of this web parsing tool to include additional websites and more sophisticated data extraction algorithms. Additionally, we plan to add a more robust export feature to allow users to export data to different file formats and locations.
